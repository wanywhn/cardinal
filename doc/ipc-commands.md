This chapter documents the Tauri commands exposed to the frontend.

| `get_sorted_view(results, sort)` | Sort a slice of slab indices on the backend so the UI can render column sorts without moving data client-side | remote sort controls |
| `update_icon_viewport(id, viewport)` | Notify backend of visible rows for Quick Look icon prefetch | `useIconViewport` |
| `trigger_rescan()` | Force a full rescan and reset lifecycle state | status bar / settings |

## Guidelines for new commands
- Prefer idempotent commands where possible; side effects should be well-documented.
- Use structured payloads and return types so the TypeScript side can model them precisely.
- For streaming-style outputs, consider using Tauri events (like `icon_update`) instead of polling.
- Maintain versioning or token IDs for long-running work so the UI can discard stale responses.
