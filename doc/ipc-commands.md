## Guidelines for new commands
- Prefer idempotent commands where possible; side effects should be well-documented.
- Use structured payloads and return types so the TypeScript side can model them precisely.
- For streaming-style outputs, consider using Tauri events (like `icon_update`) instead of polling.
- Maintain versioning or token IDs for long-running work so the UI can discard stale responses.
